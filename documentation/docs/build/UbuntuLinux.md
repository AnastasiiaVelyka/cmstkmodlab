# Build Instructions for Ubuntu Linux

## Requirements


## Building

Go to the directory to which you checked out the source code and run

   `./configure` [options]

with options as described in the [documentation](./configure).

Then run

   `source tkmodlabenv.sh`
   
in case you use `bash` or add the script to your `.bashrc`. You should
now be good to go and build the software by running

   `make`
