executables for simple calibration operations (temporarily saved here, to be integrated in main interface)

* **AngleOfCameraFrameInRefFrame_dA**:
  * orientation of the camera-view frame in the motion stage reference frame (approx. -90 degrees)
  * this corresponds to the assembly parameter called `AngleOfCameraFrameInRefFrame_dA`
